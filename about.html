		<center><h2>History:</h2></center>The history of Havre de Grace begins with the voyage of Captain John Smith in 1608.
		The area was inhabited by the Susquehannock Indians. Maryland enacted a treaty 
		with the Susquehannocks in 1652. A 200 acre tract of land in the present historic 
		district was called Harmer’s Town. After a ferry across the Susquehanna was 
		established in 1695, the area became known as Susquehanna Lower Ferry. 
		<br><br>
		There were no buildings here until 1782, when Robert Young Stokes established 
		the town, laying it out in a grid pattern modeled after Philadelphia, and giving the 
		streets Revolutionary and French names. The name Havre de Grace is attributed to 
		the Marquis de Lafayette. Approaching our shores shortly after the Revolutionary 
		War, he admired the location from the river. He was said to exclaim, “C’est Le 
		Havre!” for it reminded him of the French port city Le Havre (originally called Le 
		Havre de Grace). The city was incorporated in 1795, making Havre de Grace the 
		second oldest municipality in Maryland, after Annapolis. 
		<br><br>
		In 1813 Havre de Grace was attacked by the British and nearly burned to the 
		ground. Only a few structures survived, which are now marked with bronze plaques.
		By 1840, with the Susquehanna & Tidewater Canal and the railroad, Havre de 
		Grace was a bustling commercial location. Businesses included fish-packing and ice 
		houses, a flour & feed mill, a carriage factory, and canning and textile industries.
		From 1912-1950 The Graw Racetrack brought notoriety to Havre de Grace. In the 
		1920’s the City became known for its double-decker bridge - the only bridge of its 
		kind in the country. 
		<br><br>
		During the 1950’s – 1960’s Havre de Grace became a bedroom community for 
		Aberdeen Proving Ground and Bainbridge Naval Training Center. During the 1970’s 
		the City began to appreciate and capitalize on its history, small town ambience and 
		exceptional waterfront location.
		<br><br>
		In 2014 Smithsonian Magazine voted Havre de Grace one of the 20 Best Small 
		Towns to Visit.<br />
