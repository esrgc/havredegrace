				"Name": "The Lock House", 
				"Date": "1840", 
				"Address": "Charles Montgomery Way off Conesteo Street",
				"Description": "This tour stop is situated on the western bank of the Susquehanna River and was the outlet lock for the Susquehanna & Tidewater Canal. The brick building was the home for the lock tender and his family and also served as an office for the canal trade. The canal traversed 45 miles from this site to Wrightsville, PA. A canal was needed because the river north of Havre de Grace was too shallow and had too many boulders to navigate. The outlet lock is directly in front of the Lock House near the river. In the late 1980’s, the lock was de-silted, remnants of original gates were removed and granite walls were stabilized and straightened. Notice the bridge that pivots to cross the lock. This allowed wagons and mules access to the towpath and wharves on the riverside. Otherwise the bridge stayed open for the barges to pass through. It was reconstructed in 1984 to the original design. Tours of the Susquehanna Museum of Havre de Grace at the Lock House are available to the public April through October. Adjacent to the Lock House grounds are the North Park Trail, a nature hike and McLhinney Park, a children’s playground.",

				"Address": "Immediately north of the Abraham Jarrett Thomas House",
				"Description": "The steel-trussed ‘Amtrak’ bridge is eligible for listing on the National Trust for Historic Places. It has a movable center portion which rotates to allow passage of marine traffic taller than 50’. It is opened an average of five to eight times a year, a feat accomplished by approximately 25 workers who walk along the rails to the center, split into two groups on either side of the center span and manually swing the bridge open. The original bridge at this location was constructed on the stone pilings visible behind the Abraham Jarrett Thomas House. That bridge was built for railroad traffic and later converted to a one way vehicular toll bridge. When a second deck was added in the 1920’s to afford travel in both directions, it became the only double-decked bridge in the country. The bridge was dismantled during WWII. There was a local objection to this, but it was said that the iron was needed for the war effort.",

				"Description": "Originally this waterfront property belonged to William B. Stokes, son of Havre de Grace&#39;s founding father. The property was purchased by the Havre de Grace Ferry Company in 1818 to be used as a link on the route from Baltimore to Philadelphia. The ferry crossing was nearby. Later, this structure became the residence of Abraham Jarrett Thomas, a local banker. From 1856 to the early 1940&#39;s it served as a hotel. Known as the Lafayette Hotel, it was 	&ldquo;home away from home&rdquo; for many horse racing enthusiasts attending the Havre de Grace Race Track, &ldquo;The Graw&rdquo;<sup>1</sup> (1912-1950). This building is home to the Joseph L. Davis Post of the American Legion.",
				"Footnote": "<sup>1</sup>The Graw - The Havre de Grace Race Track&#39;s nickname came from the mispronunciation of Havre de Grace as &ldquo;Havre de Graw&rdquo;. The Graw was a major one-mile thoroughbred track which featured such horses as the great Man O&#39; War, Triple Crown winner Citation and the beloved Seabiscuit."

During the War of 1812, Matilda, 15, had her father&#39;s life spared at the hands of British Admiral George Cockburn. For her courage she was given a gold snuff box by this commander of the British attack upon Havre de Grace.",
				"Footnote": "<sup>2</sup>John O&#39;Neil -  John O&#39;Neill is considered to be one of the most historically significant figures in the history of Havre de Grace because of his role in the war of 1812. On May 3, 1813, the British, led by Admiral George Cockburn, sailed toward Havre de grace after burning Principio Furnace, an iron foundry in Perryville. Havre de Grace had for defense a few cannons and some militia men. Lieutenant John O&#39;Neill, the only officer in the area, responded to the alarm by firing on the British. When the British began firing back, O&#39;Neill&#39;s men fled. The British, 400 in number by some accounts, came ashore, sacked and burned the town and captured O&#39;Neill. Subsequent to his capture and incarceration aboard a British vessel he was released by the intercession of his daughter, Matilda.",

In addition to horse trainers and jockeys, the hotel catered to traveling salesmen and railroad workers. After the racetrack closed, the building fell into disrepair. Later it became a rooming house for local veterans. In 1984 after extensive renovation, the restaurant opened as The Crazy Swede. Currently it is Chiapparelli&#39;s, an Italian restaurant, with guest suites on the second floor.",

This structure should be examined closely to note some of its unusual features. On the front facade is a decorative wooden panel above the second floor window that penetrates the roofline. Also, the roof is highly irregular having many different planes. There are alternating courses of decorative slate on the roof. Having undergone extensive restoration in 1985, the home has been transformed into a finely appointed bed and breakfast inn named La Cle&#39; D&#39;Or (Key of Gold) Guesthouse.",

Seneca, it is one of several buildings in Havre de Grace designed by Philadelphia architect William Lewis Plack. The building material is random ashlar granite, quarried locally at Port Deposit. The trim is of Indiana limestone. The three arches on the building contain painted and stained glass windows. Note the limestone tracery incorporated as part of the window design. A 1960&#39;s wing on the south side was constructed of granite from the same quarry. Over the years the copper trimming has acquired a rich green patina. As a condition of Mr. Seneca&#39;s gift, the congregation furnished the interior of the church with pews made of white oak while the altar, pulpit and choir loft are of San Domingo mahogany. The exterior front doors slide into pockets in the wall. In 2001, the congregation completed a one million dollar interior renovation made possible by an unexpected gift willed to the church by a Havre de Grace resident.",

The large veranda has a copper roof but the primary roof is slate. The house was constructed for John Spener, a merchant and foundry owner. Later it was purchased by Charles Silver, owner of a local cannery. Notice the carriage house in the rear, now part of the bed & breakfast inn.",

He was the author of the Philippine Independence Bill. He chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee during its review of Senator Joseph McCarthy's communist charges. Tydings notably labeled McCarthy's charges as 'the most nefarious campaign of half truths and untruths in the history of this Republic.' The park is the scene of various annual events including the 4th of July carnival and fireworks, Seafood Festival and the Havre de Grace Art Show. The charming gazebo dates to the early 1900's. It was restored in the late 1980's as a local boy's Eagle Scout project. At the water's edge is the City Yacht Basin and across the channel is Tydings Island. On the north side of the Yacht Basin is the entry to the Promenade, a boardwalk that follows the shoreline for a haft mile ending at the Lighthouse.",

It was reborn as a retirement home for Franciscan nuns who added a two-story chapel to the waterfront side of the building and renamed it Bayou Villa. When sold in 1953 it was converted into apartments. After another fire in the early 1970s, the building was abandoned, given to the City of Havre de Grace and sat empty for several years. In 1983 it was restored with assistance by The Maryland Historical Trust. The City sold the building in 1984 to be developed into luxury condominiums.",

This dedicated citizen group, Friends of the Concord Point Lighthouse, restored the lighthouse and more recently the Keeper's Dwelling. The Concord Point Lighthouse is notable for being the oldest continuously operating lighthouse in the country. It is one of eight lighthouses in the northern bay area built by Havre de Grace native John Donahoo.

The building was designed by John Donahoo. This was a perfect site for a cannery since it was located at the water's edge and had adjacent railroad tracks for shipping. The railroad tracks ran down Pennington Avenue (then St. Clair Street) to the river. The trains were then ferried across the river to the tracks on the other side. Boats, laden with foods to be processed, docked at the cannery piers. The finished goods were shipped to their destination by boat or train. Red Cross canned goods were purchased by the U.S. government from the Seneca factory during the Spanish-American War (1898). The business was later sold to Edward Stockham who canned tomatoes and other vegetables grown on Maryland's Eastern shore. The goods were shipped to Baltimore and Philadelphia under the Edward Stockham, Inc. label. On the north side and rear of the building are massive granite support buttresses not to be missed.",

It would serve the family business for over 60 years. The building is notable for projecting plate glass display windows surrounded by panels of dark green marble quarried in Cardiff, MD. Notice the marble panels below the windows facing the street are of a substitute material. The original marble was replaced on these locations after being hit by a car.

The old house also provides a clue to the aspirations of early town promoters.

The back expands in a pair of joined towers and there is an interesting overhang covering the side entrance. Note the smaller building of similar style next door. Unfortunately it is built so close to the bank that it obstructs the sight of the towers in back.",

				"Description": "A beloved Havre de Grace landmark, the State Theater was a 500 seat movie theater built by Baltimore-based exhibitor, Durkee Enterprises. The brick structure was design in the style of many theaters of the day. Havre de Grace, being the largest city in the area, had two movie houses by 1908, the Willou and the Bijou. Old postcards show the Willou to the left of the First National Bank and the Bijou, next door to the Willou. Both were replaced by The State Theater. Many Havre de Gracians have fond memories of seeing movies and attending the annual children's Christmas parties held here in the 1940's and 50's. The theater closed around 1960.",

				"Address": "238 and 330 St. John St.",
				"Description": "Built as a commercial structure of simple classical design, this building has housed the Lyon's family business for four generations. George Lyon operated a ship's chandlery in the main block (328) in the 1880's. General provisions from his store were used to supply the large fishing floats which caught shad and herring in the Susquehanna River and upper Chesapeake Bay. The family opened a pharmacy in 1894 in the new wing (330). The building is located on a wedge-shaped lot on the corner of St. John Street and Lodge Lane. Modern brick veneer conceals the original brick on the front of the building, and plate glass windows have been added. The tall second story windows have stone sills with arched brick lintels above the windows of the wing (330). Don't miss the Coca Cola 'ghost sign' on the back of the buidling.",

				"Name": "The Havre de Grace Banking and Trust Building", 
				"Date": "1924", 
				"Address": "331 St. John St.",
				"Description": "In the 1860's a grain mill called Edgewood Roller Mill stood at this site. It was one of the main suppliers of grain to 'The Graw' Racetrack. The Havre de Grace Banking and Trust was built over the foundation of the old mill and served the community for 50 years. In the 1970's the building was used as a beauty school. Later it was an antique store with two apartments above. In 1985 the building was renovated into a restaurant which became MacGregor's. The facade has smooth-faced blocks of limestone over a marble foundation. Built in the Renaissance Revival style, it may have designed by William Lewis Plack, the same architect who designed the Havre de Grace Methodist Church (tour stop 23). It is a polygonal-shaped building ornamented with copper fenestration.",
